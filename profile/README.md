[TODO](https://todogroup.org/#) is an open community of practitioners who aim to create and share knowledge, collaborate on practices, tools, and other ways to run successful and effective Open Source Program Offices or similar Open Source initiatives. TODO Group is formed by its [Community](https://todogroup.org/community) participants and [General Members](https://todogroup.org/members).

## üöÄ Learn from a diverse community of professionals with years of experience building OSPOs wordwide



*‚ÄúThere is no broad template for building an open source program that applies across all industries ‚Äî or even across all organizations in a single industry. That can make its creation a challenge, but you can learn lessons from other organizations ([companies](https://todogroup.org/faq/#should-i-join), [academic institutions](https://todogroup.org/faq/#as-a-university-or-academic-institution-can-i-join-the-todo-group), [governments](https://todogroup.org/faq/#as-a-government-institution-can-i-join-the-todo-group), and more) and bring them together to fit your own organization‚Äôs requirements."*


Founded in 2012, the TODO Group is a place to share experiences, develop best practices, and work on common tooling to improve OSPO adoption and education.

## ‚úçÔ∏è DCO and Sign-Off for contributions

The TODO Charter requires that contributions are accompanied by a Developer Certificate of Origin sign-off. For ensuring it, a bot checks all incoming commits.

For users of the git command line interface, a sign-off is accomplished with the -s as part of the commit command:

`git commit -s -m 'This is a commit message'`

For users of the GitHub interface (using the "edit" button on any file, and producing a commit from it), a sign-off is accomplished by writing

`Signed-off-by: Your Name <YourName@example.org>`
